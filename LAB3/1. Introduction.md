# 🌐 **Automate Load Balancer and VPC Creation using CloudFormation**

---

## 🎯 **Project Objective**

This project focuses on automating the creation of **Load Balancers** and **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** configurations using **AWS CloudFormation**. In this lab, the task of a **Solutions Architect** is to prepare the deployment infrastructure for an e-commerce startup's backend system. This migration to a **microservice-oriented architecture** involves setting up scalable environments for **Test**, **Dev**, and **Production** systems using **EC2**, **RDS**, and **Auto Scaling**.

The primary objective is to:
- Review and fix existing **CloudFormation templates** to ensure a successful and automated deployment process for the environments.
- Deploy a robust and scalable infrastructure that supports the next release of the startup's e-commerce application.

## 🛠️ **Key Tasks**

### **First CloudFormation Template:**
1. 🌐 **Create Network Environment (VPC)**
   - **VPC with Two Public Subnets**: Set up a **VPC** with two public subnets, each in different **Availability Zones (AZs)**.
   - 🌍 **Default Route for Internet Access**: Ensure that each subnet has a default route that allows inbound/outbound traffic to the Internet.

2. 🔑 **Security Configuration**:
   - Create **security groups** for VPC resources to manage secure communication between resources while allowing external HTTP access.

### **Second CloudFormation Template:**
1. ⚙️ **Deploy Auto Scaling Web Servers Behind Load Balancer**
   - **Auto Scaling Group**: Configure an **Auto Scaling group** to deploy web servers that can automatically scale based on traffic.
   - 🔗 **HTTP Accessibility**: Ensure that web servers are accessible from the Internet via **HTTP (port 80)** and spread across different AZs.

2. 🏗️ **Self-Launching EC2 Instances with Website Script**:
   - Launch EC2 instances that automatically execute a startup script to create a simple website on deployment.

---

## 🚀 **Deployment Workflow**

### 1. **Review & Correct CloudFormation Templates**
   - Validate the templates to ensure proper configuration for:
     - **VPC** creation with subnets and Internet routing.
     - **Auto Scaling Group** setup and seamless integration with the **Load Balancer**.

### 2. **Set Up VPC & Subnets (First Template)**:
   - Create a custom **VPC** with public subnets distributed across multiple **Availability Zones**.
   - Configure Internet gateways and routing tables to allow public traffic.

### 3. **Deploy Load Balancer & Auto Scaling Group (Second Template)**:
   - Configure the **Load Balancer** to distribute incoming traffic across the EC2 instances.
   - Set up **Auto Scaling policies** to adjust the number of instances based on demand.
   - Ensure instances run a startup script to deploy a basic web application upon launch.

## 🛠️ **Key AWS Services Used**

| AWS Service                  | Purpose                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖥️ **Amazon EC2**             | Hosts the microservice-based web servers.               |
| 🏗️ **AWS CloudFormation**     | Automates the creation of infrastructure resources.     |
| 🌐 **Elastic Load Balancing**  | Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances. |
| ⚙️ **EC2 Auto Scaling**        | Scales web servers automatically based on traffic load. |
| 🗄️ **Amazon VPC**             | Isolates the infrastructure into a custom virtual network. |

## ⚙️ **Key Benefits**

- **Automation**: CloudFormation simplifies the management and replication of infrastructure across different environments (Test, Dev, Prod).
- **Scalability**: EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that resources dynamically adjust to traffic spikes, optimizing performance and costs.
- **Redundancy**: By utilizing **multi-AZ** deployments, the application ensures high availability and fault tolerance.

---

## 🔐 **Security Best Practices**

- **Network Isolation**: Leverage **VPC** to isolate the infrastructure, controlling inbound and outbound traffic with custom **security groups**.
- **Access Management**: Configure **IAM roles** and policies to manage permissions for EC2 instances and other services.
- **HTTPS Integration**: Although this project focuses on HTTP (port 80), it's recommended to set up **HTTPS** (port 443) for production environments for secure data transmission.

---

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

By automating the creation of VPC, subnets, load balancers, and auto-scaling EC2 instances using **AWS CloudFormation**, this project provides a highly scalable and fault-tolerant solution for deploying microservice-based applications. The solution ensures smooth scaling, high availability, and secure deployment for the e-commerce startup's upcoming product release.
