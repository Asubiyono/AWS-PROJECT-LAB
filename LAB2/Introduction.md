# 🛒 **Migrate a Backend E-commerce Application as a Microservice to EC2 & MySQL RDS** 🖥️

---

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

In this project, an e-commerce startup is transitioning from a **monolithic architecture** to a **microservice-oriented architecture**. The goal is to deploy key modules of their backend application as **independent microservices** using **Flask** on **Amazon EC2**, with a **MySQL database** hosted on **Amazon RDS**. This migration will ensure enhanced **scalability**, **performance**, and **secure database access**.

---

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

1. **Deploy Microservices Using Flask on EC2**  
   - Each module of the e-commerce application is implemented as a standalone microservice.
  
2. **Ensure Scalability**  
   - Implement **EC2 Autoscaling policies** to dynamically scale the microservices based on traffic demands.

3. **Set Up MySQL Database on RDS**  
   - Configure a **MySQL RDS** instance to serve as the backend database for all microservices.

4. **Secure Database Access with AWS Secrets Manager**  
   - Utilize **AWS Secrets Manager** to securely store and retrieve database credentials for the Flask applications.

---

## 🔑 **Key Steps**

### 1. **Deploy Standalone Flask-Based Microservices on EC2 Instances**
   - Each module (e.g., user authentication, order processing, inventory management) is deployed as an independent **Flask microservice** on separate **EC2 instances**.
   - This microservice-oriented approach allows for independent scaling and development of each module.

### 2. **Configure Autoscaling Policies for EC2 Instances**
   - **EC2 Autoscaling** is configured to ensure microservices can automatically scale based on traffic patterns, optimizing resource usage during high-demand periods.
   - This ensures the application remains performant while managing costs effectively. 

### 3. **Set Up and Connect to MySQL Database on RDS**
   - A **MySQL database** is set up on **Amazon RDS** to serve as the central database for all microservices.
   - Each microservice will connect to the **RDS** backend using a **secure and efficient connection** to handle data-related transactions.

### 4. **Securely Manage RDS Credentials with AWS Secrets Manager**
   - **AWS Secrets Manager** is integrated with the Flask applications to securely access the MySQL RDS credentials.
   - This allows for **dynamic retrieval** of credentials, enhancing security by keeping sensitive information out of the application code.

---

## ⚙️ **Architecture Overview**

- **Flask Microservices** are deployed across multiple EC2 instances.
- **MySQL RDS** is the centralized database backend for all services.
- **AWS Secrets Manager** secures the dynamic retrieval of database credentials.

## 🛠️ **Key AWS Services Used**

| AWS Service                  | Purpose                                                 |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| 🖥️ **Amazon EC2**             | Host independent Flask microservices as scalable instances. |
| ⚙️ **EC2 Autoscaling**        | Automatically scale EC2 instances based on traffic.     |
| 🗄️ **Amazon RDS (MySQL)**     | Backend database for storing e-commerce application data. |
| 🔑 **AWS Secrets Manager**    | Securely manage and retrieve MySQL RDS credentials.     |

## 📈 **Benefits of the Microservices Architecture**

- **Scalability**: Each microservice can scale independently based on traffic, ensuring optimal performance during high-demand periods.
- **Security**: By using **AWS Secrets Manager**, sensitive credentials (such as database passwords) are securely managed.
- **Performance**: **EC2 Autoscaling** ensures that performance remains consistent without overprovisioning resources.
- **Maintainability**: Microservices allow for easier updates and maintenance, as each service is independent of the others.

---

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- **Secrets Manager Integration**: Securely manages database credentials for the **Flask microservices**.
- **Encrypted Connections**: The **MySQL RDS** instance is configured with **encrypted connections** to ensure data integrity during transmission.

## 🏁 **Conclusion**

This migration project successfully transitions the e-commerce application from a monolithic to a **microservice-based architecture**, providing the startup with enhanced **scalability**, **security**, and **performance optimization**. By utilizing **Amazon EC2**, **MySQL RDS**, and **AWS Secrets Manager**, the company ensures its backend is ready to handle future growth and scaling demands with ease.
