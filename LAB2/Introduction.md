## **Migrate a Backend E-commerce Application as a Microservice to EC2 & MySQL RDS**

### **Project Objective**  
This project involves migrating key modules of an e-commerce startup's application from a monolithic architecture to a microservice-oriented architecture. The goal is to deploy each module as an independent microservice using Flask, running on EC2, with a MySQL database hosted on RDS. The migration will ensure scalability and secure database access.

### **Project Objectives**:
1. **Deploy Microservices Using Flask on EC2**:  
   - Implement each independent module as a standalone microservice.
   
2. **Ensure Scalability**:  
   - Use EC2 autoscaling policies to ensure the microservices can scale based on traffic demands.
   
3. **Set Up MySQL Database on RDS**:  
   - Configure a MySQL database on RDS to serve as the backend for all microservices.
   
4. **Implement AWS Secrets Manager**:  
   - Use Secrets Manager to securely access RDS credentials dynamically from the Flask application.

### **Key Steps**:
1. **Deploy Standalone Flask-Based Microservices on EC2 Instances**:  
   Each microservice will be deployed independently on separate EC2 instances to handle different features of the e-commerce platform.

2. **Configure Autoscaling Policies to Handle Varying Traffic**:  
   Ensure that EC2 instances can automatically scale in or out depending on traffic, ensuring optimal performance and cost management.

3. **Set Up and Connect Each Service to the MySQL Database on RDS**:  
   Configure a MySQL RDS instance to serve as the central database for all microservices. Connect each microservice to this backend using secure access.

4. **Securely Manage RDS Credentials Using Secrets Manager**:  
   AWS Secrets Manager will be used to securely store and retrieve database credentials, ensuring the Flask applications access RDS securely and dynamically.
