# 🖥️ **AWS Network Monitoring Solution using VPC Flow Logs and Amazon CloudWatch** 🔍

---

## 🛠️ **Project Overview**

In this AWS lab, the role of a **SysOps Administrator** involves designing and implementing a **network monitoring solution** for a company that recently experienced malicious activities targeting its network infrastructure. The goal is to ensure **compliance**, monitor **key metrics**, and set up **automated alerts** to detect any suspicious activity. 

This solution leverages **AWS VPC Flow Logs** and **Amazon CloudWatch** to track network traffic and trigger real-time notifications for security events.

## 📝 **Project Objectives**

1. 📡 **Configure AWS VPC Flow Logs** for all network interfaces in the VPC to capture detailed traffic information.
2. 📊 **Ingest VPC Flow Logs into CloudWatch Logs** for continuous monitoring and log retention.
3. 🚨 **Set up CloudWatch filters and alarms** to detect potential security threats and trigger **Amazon SNS notifications** for immediate alerts.
4. 🔍 **Analyze VPC Flow Logs** stored in Amazon S3 using **Amazon Athena** to gain deeper insights into network access patterns and detect long-term threats.

## 🌐 **Scenario: Real-Time Network Monitoring and Security**

The **network monitoring solution** must be capable of detecting **security events** and sending **real-time alerts** to the team. By implementing **AWS VPC Flow Logs**, the system will capture detailed information about the **IP traffic** across network interfaces. These logs will then be ingested into **CloudWatch Logs**, where alarms and filters will monitor the logs for any unusual activity, such as:

- Unauthorized access attempts 🕵️‍♂️
- Unusual traffic spikes 📈
- Suspicious IP addresses or protocols 🔐

If a security event is detected, **Amazon SNS** will immediately notify the response team to ensure timely action.

For deeper **network analysis**, **Amazon Athena** will be used to query and analyze the logs stored in S3, allowing identification of **network trends** and **potential threats** over time.

## 🚀 **Project Workflow**

1. **Step 1: Configure AWS VPC Flow Logs**
   - Capture all incoming and outgoing IP traffic in your VPC using **VPC Flow Logs**.
   - Store logs in **Amazon CloudWatch** for real-time monitoring and in **Amazon S3** for long-term analysis.

2. **Step 2: Set Up CloudWatch Monitoring**
   - Create filters to scan VPC Flow Logs for suspicious traffic.
   - Set up **CloudWatch Alarms** to detect security events and trigger **Amazon SNS Notifications**.

3. **Step 3: Automate Alerts and Notifications**
   - Configure **SNS notifications** to alert the appropriate teams when malicious activity is detected.
   - Automate responses to reduce the time between detection and action.

4. **Step 4: Analyze Flow Logs with Amazon Athena**
   - Store VPC Flow Logs in **Amazon S3**.
   - Use **Amazon Athena** to run queries and generate insights into network access patterns.
   - Identify trends, such as traffic sources, protocols used, and unusual activities over time.
