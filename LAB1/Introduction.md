## 🔄 **Data Pipeline Workflow**

1. **Data Ingestion** 🚖
   - Taxi trip data from various sources is streamed in real-time via **AWS Kinesis Data Streams**, capturing each trip's metadata.

2. **Real-Time Processing** ⏳
   - **AWS Lambda** processes the streamed data, transforming it into valuable insights (e.g., identifying **peak hours** or **fare trends**).

3. **Data Storage & Retrieval** 🗂️
   - Processed data is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB**, offering **agile querying** for further business analysis and decision-making.

4. **Monitoring & Scaling** 🔧
   - Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor the pipeline, ensuring real-time alerts for any bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and enabling quick scaling to handle increased data loads.
