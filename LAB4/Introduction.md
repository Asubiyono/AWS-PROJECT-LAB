# 🛡️ **Improve Application Security Posture by Automating Security Controls and Data Protection** 🔐

---

## 📊 **Project Overview**

In this project, a **Solutions Architect** at DataTech Innovations is tasked with enhancing the security posture of the company's flagship product, **"DataGuardian"**. This technology leverages advanced data analytics to provide robust security solutions to its customers. The primary goal is to ensure **data encryption** at all times, protecting sensitive information stored in **Amazon RDS** and **Amazon EBS volumes** through **automated security controls**.

🔒 **Key Services Involved:**
- Amazon RDS
- AWS CloudTrail
- Amazon CloudWatch
- AWS EC2
- AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
- Amazon SNS

---

## 📝 **Objectives**

1. 🖥️ **Configure AWS CloudTrail** to capture trail events and send logs to **Amazon CloudWatch** for continuous monitoring.  
2. 🛠️ **Create KMS-encrypted** Amazon RDS databases and **EC2 EBS volumes** to ensure secure data storage.  
3. 🧑‍💻 **Develop CloudWatch Logs metric filters and alarms** to detect unencrypted Amazon RDS databases.  
4. 🚨 **Trigger Amazon SNS notifications** for any deviations, such as unencrypted RDS databases or EBS volumes.  
5. 📡 **Monitor unencrypted EC2 EBS volumes** using CloudWatch Logs and metric alarms.  
6. 📨 **Automate real-time notifications** for security deviations through Amazon CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and SNS.

## 📘 **Project Scenario**

In order to **fortify security** for the **DataGuardian** product, this project implements automated monitoring for encryption standards across key AWS services.

- **Unencrypted data** in **Amazon RDS databases** or **EC2 EBS volumes** will trigger alarms and **send notifications** using **AWS CloudTrail** and **Amazon CloudWatch**.  
- **Amazon SNS** will distribute real-time notifications to alert the relevant teams whenever there are deviations from encryption standards.  
- This approach ensures that **all data remains encrypted** at all times, strengthening the **confidentiality** and **integrity** of the data infrastructure.
